<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure and install a SnappyData cluster on Pivotal Container Service (PKS) and expose it via Kubernetes services.

##<a id='install'></a> Download SnappyData Service for PCF (PKS) (Beta)

1. Download the SnappyData product Helm Chart package from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

2. Extract the downloaded Helm Chart package on your local machine.


##<a id='deploykubernetes'></a> Deploy SnappyData on PKS 

The SnappyData Helm chart uses Kubernetes [statefulsets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) to launch the locator, lead, and server processes in the SnappyData cluster. 

To deploy SnappyData on PKS, perform the following steps:

1. (Optional) Before you launch the SnappyData Service on PKS, you can optionally edit the `snappydata > values.yaml`  file to change the default configurations in the SnappyData chart.
	<br><br>
	Configurations can be specified in the respective attributes for locators, leaders, and servers in this file. For more information, see [List of Configuration Parameters for SnappyData Chart](#chartparameters).

2. Run the following command to deploy the SnappyData Helm chart:

	```
	helm install --name snappydata --namespace snappy ./snappydata/
	```
	<br>
    This command launches the SnappyData cluster within a namespace called `snappy` and displays the Kubernetes objects created by the SnappyData Helm chart in the console.
	<br><br>
	The process takes a few minutes to complete before the servers are available. You can monitor the Kubernetes Dashboard to check the status of the components. 
	<br><br>
    By default, the SnappyData Helm chart deploys a SnappyData cluster which consists of one locator, one lead, two servers, and services to access SnappyData endpoints.

For more information about accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard, see [Accessing the Dashboard UI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/#accessing-the-dashboard-ui) in the Kubernetes documentation.

SnappyData chart dynamically provisions volumes for servers, locators, and leads. These volumes and the data in it are retained even after the chart deployment is deleted.

###<a id='chartparameters'></a>List of Configuration Parameters for SnappyData chart

You can modify the `values.yaml`  file to configure the SnappyData chart. The following table lists the configuration parameters available for this chart:

| Parameter| Description | Default |
| ---------| ------------| --------|
| `image` |  Docker repo from which the SnappyData Docker image is pulled.    |  `snappydatainc/snappydata`   |
| `imageTag` |  Tag of the SnappyData Docker image that is pulled. |   |
| `imagePullPolicy` | Pull policy for the image.  | `IfNotPresent` |
| `locators.conf` | List of the configuration options that is passed to the locators. | |
| `locators.resources` | Resource configuration for the locator Pods. User can configure CPU/memory requests and limit the usage. | `locators.requests.memory` is set to `1024Mi`. |
| `locators.persistence.storageClass` | Storage class that is used while dynamically provisioning a volume. | Default value is not defined so `default` storage class for the cluster is chosen.  |
| `locators.persistence.accessMode` | [Access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) that is used for the dynamically provisioned volume. | `ReadWriteOnce` |
| `locators.persistence.size` | Size of the dynamically provisioned volume. | `10Gi` |
| `servers.replicaCount` | Number of servers that are started in a SnappyData cluster. | `2` |
| `servers.conf` | List of the configuration options that are passed to the servers. | |
| `servers.resources` | Resource configuration for the server Pods. You can configure CPU/memory requests and limit the usage. | `servers.requests.memory` is set to `4096Mi` |
| `servers.persistence.storageClass` | Storage class that is used while dynamically provisioning a volume. | Default value is not defined so `default` storage class for the cluster will be chosen.  |
| `servers.persistence.accessMode` | [Access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) for the dynamically provisioned volume. | `ReadWriteOnce` |
| `servers.persistence.size` | Size of the dynamically provisioned volume. | `10Gi` |
| `leaders.conf` | List of configuration options that can be passed to the leaders. | |
| `leaders.resources` | Resource configuration for the server pods. You can configure CPU/memory requests and limits the usage. | `leaders.requests.memory` is set to `4096Mi` |
| `leaders.persistence.storageClass` | Storage class that is used while dynamically provisioning a volume. | Default value is not defined so `default` storage class for the cluster will be chosen.  |
| `leaders.persistence.accessMode` | [Access mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) for the dynamically provisioned volume. | `ReadWriteOnce` |
| `leaders.persistence.size` | Size of the dynamically provisioned volume. | `10Gi` |


The following sample shows the configuration used to start four servers, each with a heap size of 4096 MB:

```
servers:
  replicaCount: 4
  ## config options for servers
  conf: "-heap-size=4096m"
```

You can specify SnappyData [configuration parameters](https://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/configuring_cluster/configuring_cluster/#configuration-files) in the `servers.conf`, `locators.conf`, and `leaders.conf` attributes for servers, locators, and leaders respectively.
